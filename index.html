    <h2>Blackjack Rules</h2>
    <li>The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</li>

    <li>Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.</li>
    
    <li> Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.</li>
    
    <li> To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.</li>
    
    <li> If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.</li>
    
    <li> If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.</li> 
    
    <li>Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.</li>
    
    <li> Doubling is like a hit, only the bet is doubled and you only get one more card.</li>
    
    <li> Split can be done when you have two of the same card - the pair is split into two hands.</li>
    
    <li>Splitting also doubles the bet, because each new hand is worth the original bet.</li>
    
    <li>You can only double/split on the first move, or first move of a hand created by a split.</li>
    
    <li>You cannot play on two aces after they are split.</li>
    
    <li> You can double on a hand resulting from a split, tripling or quadrupling you bet.</li>
